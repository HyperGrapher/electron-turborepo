# Electron Turborepo Starter

A secure boilerplate for Electron applications using Turborepo, Next.js, and Vite.

#### Turborepo deaomon issue:
[Github Issue](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/issues/3455)

## What's inside?

This Turborepo uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a packages manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `electron/main`: The Electron main process
- `electron/preload`: Electron preload scripts
- `electron/renderer`: The Electron renderer process built with React + Vite
- `electron/electron-versions`: Helper utilities for Electron versioning
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for building cross-platform desktop applications
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and building

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

To build only the Electron packages:

```
npm run build:electron-pkgs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

To start the Electron application in development mode:

```
npm run start:electron
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
